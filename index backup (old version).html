                <p>As a designer, I like to stay attentive to the details and intricacies of each project, ensuring that
                    the
                    final product is well thought out and retains its value over time.</p>

                </h2>
                <p>My vision as a designer is deeply rooted in fully owning the materials I work with. To me, a design
                    is only truly successful when every element has been created, adapted, or improved by me to
                    perfectly align with my vision and desires.
                    This process of refining and perfecting not only brings me greater satisfaction, but also helps me
                    to truly make my work my own.</p>

                <p>For me, good design is all about individuality—the ability to make a design instantly recognizable as
                    your unique creation. That, in my eyes, is what sets a designer apart from the crowd. This doesn’t
                    just mean that a design should be visually striking, but also that it tells a story that reflects my
                    perspective and values.</p>

                <p>Ultimately, I see design as an expression of my individuality—a way to share my vision of the world
                    and create something lasting and meaningful for myself and those around me.</p>

                <p>Beyond my work as a design student, you’ll often find me behind the decks, spinning obscure tunes and
                    digging through record store crates to uncover hidden gems. When I’m not immersed in music, I’m
                    usually honing my creativity by experimenting with graphic design, producing music, or exploring new
                    projects in TouchDesigner.</p>

                <p>In my free time, I enjoy making cocktails, watching films, and escaping into different worlds through
                    both fantasy novels and classic literature.</p>
